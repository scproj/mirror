Through her art, she discovered similarities between American Sign Language and music, and she realized that sound doesn't have to be known solely through the ears -- it can be felt, seen and experienced as an idea. In this endearing talk, she invites us to open our eyes and ears and participate in the rich treasure of visual language.","url":"http://www.ted.com/talks/christine_sun_kim_the_enchanting_music_of_sign_language","author_name":"Christine Sun Kim","author_url":"http://www.ted.com/speakers/christine_sun_kim","provider_name":"TED","provider_url":"http://ted.com","thumbnail_url":"http://tedcdnpe-a.akamaihd.net/images/ted/d7e4f88be73a3d0acc4ee579c7fbe7544c436626_240x180.jpg?lang=en","thumbnail_width":240,"thumbnail_height":180,"html":"\u003Ciframe src=\"https://embed-ssl.ted.com/talks/lang/en/christine_sun_kim_the_enchanting_music_of_sign_language.html\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"}
