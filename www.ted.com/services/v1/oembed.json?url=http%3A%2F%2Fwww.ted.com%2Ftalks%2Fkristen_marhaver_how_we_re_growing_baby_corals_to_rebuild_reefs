As she admits, it's easy to get sad about the state of coral reefs; they're in the news lately because of how quickly they're bleaching, dying and turning to slime. But the good news is that we're learning more and more about these amazing marine invertebrates -- including how to help them (and help them help us). This biologist and TED Senior Fellow offers a glimpse into the wonderful and mysterious lives of these hard-working and fragile creatures.","url":"http://www.ted.com/talks/kristen_marhaver_how_we_re_growing_baby_corals_to_rebuild_reefs","author_name":"Kristen Marhaver","author_url":"http://www.ted.com/speakers/kristen_marhaver","provider_name":"TED","provider_url":"http://ted.com","thumbnail_url":"http://tedcdnpe-a.akamaihd.net/images/ted/f1e5336ce97d32386248f4feb201e1337591dd86_240x180.jpg?lang=en","thumbnail_width":240,"thumbnail_height":180,"html":"\u003Ciframe src=\"https://embed-ssl.ted.com/talks/kristen_marhaver_how_we_re_growing_baby_corals_to_rebuild_reefs.html\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen\u003E\u003C/iframe\u003E"}
